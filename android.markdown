# Android, A Few Weeks In

I received a brand new Nexus 4 in the mail a few weeks ago after being a long
time iPhone user and 

## Hardware
### Liked

* Screen -- no accolades here, but its no worse than the iPhone's Retina
  display.

### Disliked

* Size -- way too big
* "Physical" button placement
* touchscreen -- doesn't do as good a job as iphone at figuring out where I am.
  The iPhone corrects your touch to where it "looks" like you are pressing
  whereas Android seems to only go with where skin touches. I find myself
  tapping the screen multiple times to get it to do what I want.  Haven't felt
  that way on an iPhone since maybe the 3g?
* Camera -- no competition with the iPhone 4s or 5. 

## Software
### Notification Bar

Stunning. By far one of Android's greatest assets. The drop down is easy to use
and very visually appealing.  Being able to just swipe away notifications I'm
not interested in/I'm done with is fantastic.

### Task switcher

Love it. The iOS's icon carousel just doesn't compare at all. Being able to pop
it up scroll around and swipe away apps reduces the barriers to app switching.
This has been great with copying between apps or flipping between lastpass.

### App Springboard (I'm sure this has an actual name)

The visual metaphor is fairly confusing.  If you pull to the one side it tilts,
but flipping through is like a deck of cards. Why is this different than the
home screens which are very clearly laid out next to each other? I've also had
apps disappear from the launcher after an update. Why can't you search it?
Bizarre. The widgets list is entirely useless.  Things aren't consistently
named and are sorted alphabetically rather than by which app created them so it
tends to go on for pages after even just a few apps are in installed

### Interface consistency is all over the map among google apps

### Now 

is useless

### Timer/clock

Lovely app that works well, but the interface confuses me.  As you can see on
the main screen ![main screen]() 

### Keyboard 

is nice; don't find swype style useful, love the corrections on the top of the
keyboard; a little slow/sometimes misses taps. This may be hardware not
software related

### Camera app

Devastatingly bad. I'll often take a picture; confirm that it looks fine; press
check mark and suddenly I have a different and ruinous image.

## Third Party stuff
### Twitter app

# Android, A Few Weeks In

I received a brand new Nexus 4 in the mail a few weeks ago after being a long
time iPhone user and

## Nexus 4
### Liked

#### Screen

No accolades here, but its no worse than the iPhone's Retina display.

### Disliked

#### Size

* way too big

* "Physical" button placement

#### touchscreen

Doesn't do as good a job as iPhone at figuring out where I am. The iPhone
corrects your touch to where it "looks" like you are pressing whereas Android
seems to only go with where skin touches. I find myself tapping the screen
multiple times to get it to do what I want. Haven't felt that way on an iPhone
since maybe the 3G?

### Camera

The camera has been consistently a huge disappointment when I'm out and about.
My iPhone has essentially replaced my DSLR for quick snapshots when I'm out but
the Nexus 4 is basically useless.

## Android 4.2 (Jelly Bean)
### Notification Bar

Stunning. By far one of Android's greatest assets. The drop down is easy to use
and very visually appealing. Being able to just swipe away notifications I'm
not interested in or I'm done with is fantastic.

### Task switcher

Love it. The iOS's icon carousel just doesn't compare at all. Being able to pop
it up scroll around and swipe away apps reduces the barriers to app switching.
This has been great with copying between apps or flipping between lastpass.

### App Springboard (I'm sure this has an actual name)

The visual metaphor is fairly confusing. If you pull to the one side it tilts,
but flipping through is like a deck of cards. Why is this different than the
home screens which are very clearly laid out next to each other? I've also had
apps disappear from the launcher after an update. Why can't you search it?
Bizarre. The widgets list is entirely useless. Things aren't consistently
named and are sorted alphabetically rather than by which app created them so it
tends to go on for pages after even just a few apps are in installed

### Interface consistency is all over the map among google apps

### Now

is useless

### Timer/clock

Lovely app that works well, but the interface confuses me. As you can see on
the main screen ![main screen]()

### Keyboard

I have mixed feelings here. I'll start off by saying that I don't find
swype-style input particularly useful. I spent a day or so forcing myself to
use it and did not find value in it over normal tap input. You could fault me
here for only using the Google provided keyboard but I didn't find the concept
compelling enough to buy the actual "swype" app. On the other hand, I love the
corrections on the top of the keyboard. Having to peck at the little correction
chicklet is quite annoying but the little bar on top of the keyboard is easy to
hit. Often I can even hit the correct word while I am typing and keep going.
The only problems I've had are that the keyboard can be a little slow and
sometimes misses taps. This could certainly be related to the hardware issues
I mentioned before, but regardless I find it very annoying.

### Camera app

Devastatingly bad. I'll often take a picture and at the confirm screen it will
look fine. I then confirm the photo and am shown a new and awful rendition of
what I just took. ![screenshots]()

## Third Party stuff
### Twitter app
